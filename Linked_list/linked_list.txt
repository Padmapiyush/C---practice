Linked List

"A linked list is a linear data structure in which the elements are not stored at contagious memory locations."
The elements in a linked list are stored using a pointer.

Every linked list contains nodes where every node consists a data part and a pointer part to 
 store the reference to the next node.

Why Linked list ?
1. Size of Array is fixed.
2. Array modification is complex and time consuming.

Drawbacks of linked list :-
1. Random access is not allowed.
2. It contains pointer that occupies extra space in memory.
3. linked list elements are not contagious location.

Time Complexity:
Search - O(n)
Insert - O(1)
Delete - O(1)

Syntax:- 

In C++ :- 
            class Node(){
                public:
                int data;
                Node* next;
            } ;

In C   :- 
            struct Node(){
                int data;
                struct Node* next;
            };
