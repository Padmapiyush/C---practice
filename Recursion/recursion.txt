Recursion

"Functions calls itself directly or indirectly"

1. It helps us to reduce the length of the code.
2. It helps us performing same opertaions with different inputs.

Recursion uses more memory because the recursive added to the stack with
 each recursice calls and keeps the values there until the call is finished.
 The recursive Functions uses LIFO (Last In First Out) structure just like 
 the stack data structure.

ex. int fact(int n){
    if(n<=1){
        return 1;
    }
    else{
        return n* fact(n-1)
    }
}

There are direct and indirect type of recursion. 
1. Direct recursion :- In this recursion the function is called in its own block of code.
                
                void directfun(){
                    // code
                    directfun();
                    // code
                }

2. Indirect recursion :- In this recursion the funcion is called another block of code. 
                
                void directfun1(){
                    // code
                    directfun2();
                    //code
                }

                void directfun2(){
                    //code
                    directfun1();
                    //code
                }
