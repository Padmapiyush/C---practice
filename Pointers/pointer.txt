A pointer in C++ is used to share a memory address among different contexts (primarily functions).
They are used whenever a function needs to modify the content of a variable, but it does not have ownership.

Syntax:- 
           type *var-name;
example:-  
           int    *ip;    /* pointer to an integer */
           double *dp;    /* pointer to a double */
           float  *fp;    /* pointer to a float */
           char   *ch     /* pointer to a character */

NULL Pointers:-
